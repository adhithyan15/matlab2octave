I program a lot in a different languages. One of it is Matlab. Octave is a free software that is almost compatible with matlab. You need some syntax modifications to make the Matlab code work in Octave. For people who cannot afford a Matlab license, Octave is their best bet. This compiler converts Matlab code into **syntactically correct** Octave code.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nPlease read the documentation for this project at https://github.com/adhithyan15/matlab2octave/wiki/Documentation to learn more about how to use this project for your purpose.\r\n\r\n### Issues\r\nPlease post your issues in on the issues tab.
