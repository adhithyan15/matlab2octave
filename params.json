Thanks for taking time to visit my simple project matlab2octave. I program a lot in a different languages. One of it is matlab. Octave is a free software that is almost compatible with matlab. You need some syntax modifications to make the matlab code work in octave. For people who cannot afford a matlab license, Octave is their best bet. Instead of manually changing the syntax of your matlab file to make it octave compatible, this project achieves it automatically.\r\n\r\nThis is a very simple project with not more than 1000 lines of code combined. This is also my first open source project that I actually used. \r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nPlease read the documentation for this project at https://github.com/adhithyan15/matlab2octave/wiki/Documentation to learn more about how to use this project for your purpose. \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis project was completely written from scratch by me(@adhithyan15). I am sophomore in college who is really interested in open source technologies. Visit my other ongoing projects at https://github.com/adhithyan15/. You can also email me at adhithyan15 at gmail dotcom. \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf you need any help read the documentation or email me at adhithyan15 at gmail dotcom.
